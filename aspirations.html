						My long-term goal is to make the most amount of money
						with the least amount of effort. I have no idea what I would want to do for a career yet, but the things 
						that I currently like are things that I'd rather have stay hobbies, so I'm open to jobs that will make 
						me a lot of money. If it was something that I didn't hate doing that'd be great too. I think I would be 
						okay doing a boring job as long as I made enough money to do whatever I wanted on the side. 
					</span>
					<span class = "line-break">
						Other than that though, I have small goals like improving in piano and art. I'd also like to travel the world
						and visit places like Germany, China or Japan. I've only been out of the country once, and that was to go to 
						Florida in 2012 so I don't really remember it. I've never been out of the continent either, and I'd really like to 
						go sightseeing in other places and see what the culture is like.
