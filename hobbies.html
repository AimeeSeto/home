						<h2>Piano/Instruments</h2>
						<span class = "line-break">
							For my current skill level, I feel like I've been playing piano for too long, so I won't tell you when I started. I think 
							I'm so bad because there was a time where I practiced at the most maybe 5 minutes a week, and still continued to progress through levels.
							But, after I started doing another activity which I will not disclose, I started appreciating piano lessons and playing

							piano itself a lot more, so now it's just something that I like doing. One week when I was trying to speed-learn a piece,
							I think I played too much and too often that I messed up my wrists a bit, so now I can't play too long without my wrists aching. It's still 
							fun though, and I like playing songs in my own time. I wish I played more during quarantine and the summer where I really did have 
							a lot of free time, but at the same time it's not like I'll be stopped from playing piano later on. I want to be able to get
							to a point where I can improv short tunes or play songs by ear, but I've got no chance as of now since I have virtually no knowledge 
							on music theory and I really suck at ear training.
						</span>
						<span class = "line-break1"></span>
						<span class = "line-break">
							Other than piano, I play 3 other instruments (not including recorder): flute, trumpet, and ukulele. I started playing flute in grade 6 
							when we were given a choice in music, and I chose it because I thought it'd be quiet enough to be hidden by all the other instruments; that
							way no one would notice if I made any mistakes. Not only that though, I think the flute is a very pretty instrument and it was fun playing it.
							I played it through grade 6 and 7, and played it in grade 8 for band as well. 
						</span>
						<span class = "line-break">
							In grade 8 for music classes, I switched to trumpet. While 
							trumpet is fun to play, I'm not great at it because I can't push enough air to go up higher. I basically switched because I wanted to push 
							the buttons, but I stuck with it through the year and now I miss playing both flute and trumpet. 
						</span>
						<span class = "line-break">
							During quarantine though, my brother bought himself a ukulele but said it was too small. I'd been wanting a ukulele so I got to take it, and 
							I started to learn on my own. As of August I knew three songs, and still know a grand total of three songs. My fingers hurt for a while when 
							I first started to play but like every other instrument I mentioned, it's fun to play.
						</span>
						<span class = "line-break">
							Due to my current piano level I'm expected to do music theory so I do online classes, and I don't know if it's just me but I actually kind of 
							like learning music theory. I'm hoping that I can get it ingrained in my head so I can recognize different things about what I play.
						</span>
						<span class = "line-break">
							While I'd like to get better at the instruments I already play, there's also a bunch more that I'd still like to play, so I'm hoping that I'll 
							have the opportunity to later on.

							So something I like to do in my free time is draw, and even though I'm laughably slow at it, 
							it's still something that I enjoy doing. To be honest, I'd call myself mediocre or decent at best,
							but one of the best things about art is that it's not hard to improve through practice and repeitition.
							Everyone starts somewhere, so if you feel like you aren't that good you shouldn't worry about it too much;

							To the left is just a work in progress drawing that I don't really plan on finishing, and to the right is a collaboration drawing

							See, people tend to say they dislike art because they're bad at it,
							but since art is so subjective I feel like your skill level isn't extremely important and you can just have fun
							messing around and drawing something dumb.

							Drawing doesn't have to be taken seriously, and that's what I think makes art enjoyable,

						<h2>Shows</h2>

							For a while now I've been spending more hours infront of a screen than I'd be proud to admit, and a lot of it came from
							watching Youtube and recently, Twitch. I won't mention any of the creators I watch for no particular reason, but I can 
							mention some shows I've watched instead.
						</span>
						<span class = "line-break">
							Compared to other people I don't think I watch that much anime, and it usually takes a lot for me to start a series. I'm 
							perhaps a bit basic when it comes to what I watch too, since I usually just watch whatever's popular or was recommended
							to me. I've watched animes of different genres, but I usually just like light-hearted stories with fun characters who have 
							funny interactions. To the right, you'll find screenshots of my favourite moment in <span class = "title-font">&ldquo;My Hero Academia&rdquo;</span>.
						</span>
						<span class = "line-break">
							Other than anime, I've tried some dramas like <span class = "title-font">&ldquo;Boys Over Flowers&rdquo;</span> and <span class = "title-font">
							&ldquo;The Prince Of Tennis&rdquo;</span>, but ultimately was unable to take them seriously. No offence to whoever worked hard on the shows. I might 
							still watch them though, because when I watch things I just like to turn off my brain for a while and enjoy something mindlessly.

						<h2>Reading</h2>

							Just like my tv watch-time, my time spent reading has decreased too, just not gradually at all. I do still enjoy it though, and

							Usually every summer I re-read the entire Harry Potter series to try to reassure myself that I didn't waste money buying the 
							set, but I got so lazy I didn't do it this year. Some cool people got me the Hunger Games prequel though, so I spent a 
							couple days on that, and I'm currently on chapter 6 of <span class = "title-font">&ldquo;Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind&rdquo;</span>.
							My lack of reading is only if you count traditional reading though, because during quarantine I made a habit of spending an unfortunate
